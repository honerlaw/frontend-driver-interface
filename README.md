# Frontend Driver Interface

View the latest FDI spec on [swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/supertokens/FDI).

This is the API spec that is exposed by the SuperTokens backend SDKs which integrate with your backend APIs. An example SDK is our [NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node).

It is meant to be consumed only by frontend clients like a website client or a mobile app client.
